Title: Fast and URL-Safe Base64 Encoder and Decoder
Version: 1.1
Authors@R: c(
    person("Michel", "Lang", NULL, "michellang@gmail.com", role = c("cre", "aut")),
    person(NULL, "Apache Foundation", NULL, NULL, role = c("ctb", "cph")),
    person(NULL, "Free Software Foundation", NULL, NULL, role = c("ctb", "cph"))
    )
Description: In contrast to RFC3548, the 62nd character ("+") is replaced with
    "-", the 63rd character ("/") is replaced with "_". Furthermore, the encoder
    does not fill the string with trailing "=". The resulting encoded strings
    comply to the regular expression pattern "[A-Za-z0-9_-]" and thus are
    safe to use in URLs or for file names.
    The package also comes with a simple base32 encoder/decoder suited for
    case insensitive file systems.
